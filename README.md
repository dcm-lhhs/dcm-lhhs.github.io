# MasterMindAI Final Project

To get a quick introduction of the project, visit the [project website](https://dcm-lhhs.github.io). For some reason, the school network sometimes doesn't allow to enter the site. So try switching to another network, and make sure you use a PC/laptop to see it for the best experience.

You can directly access the project source code on this [repository](https://github.com/davidcm-dev/MasterMindAI).

**Note:** right now, it's not possible to play the engine in lichess.org as the project website says, because I don't have a server to run it 24/7. However, you can download the executable file and run it on the [lichess-bot API](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot) to try it.
